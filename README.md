# Old ROBLOX Asset delivery link
Asset delivery for legacy ROBLOX clients. To request your files upload into this repository, ask me directly via Discord (kerbal_official).

## If you never received the usable link when your files were uploaded, this is how it can be used:
`http://raw.githubusercontent.com/KerbalOfficial/old-rblx-assetdelivery/refs/heads/main/assets/{username}/{project_name}/{textures|sounds|music|fonts|scripts|particles|sky}/{asset_name}`
